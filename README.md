Parametric Continuum Robot with Kinematics

These Grasshopper scripts generate a 3D printable parametric continuum robot with kinematics simulation. The script allows you to define various parameters of the robot and outputs a 3D model ready for printing, along with kinematic simulations for analysis.

Description
This Grasshopper script is designed to help users create a continuum robot by specifying parameters such as segment length, diameter, and number of segments. The script includes kinematic simulations to visualize the robot's movement and ensure its functionality before 3D printing.

Features
  Parametric Design: Easily adjust the dimensions of the robot's segments.
  Kinematic Simulation: Visualize and analyze the robot's movements.
  3D Printable Model: Generate a 3D model ready for printing.
  User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive controls for parameter adjustment.
Inputs
  Segment Length: The length of each segment of the robot.
  Segment Diameter: The diameter of each segment.
  Number of Segments: The total number of segments in the robot.
Outputs
  3D Model: A 3D printable model of the continuum robot.
  Kinematic Simulation: A simulation of the robot's kinematics for various configurations.
Usage
  Load the Script: Open the Grasshopper script in Rhino.
  Set Parameters: Adjust the input parameters (Segment Length, Segment Diameter, Number of Segments, Material Type) according to your requirements.
  Generate Model: The script automatically generates the 3D model based on the provided parameters.
  Simulate Kinematics: Use the kinematic simulation feature to test and visualize the robot's movements.
  Export for Printing: Once satisfied with the design and simulation, export the 3D model for printing.
